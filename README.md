# PakistanFloodsImpact-Dashboard

1. Project Title / Headline

üåä Pakistan Floods Impact Dashboard ‚Äì 2025
An interactive data visualization tool designed to monitor and analyze the impact of floods across multiple regions of Pakistan, providing insights into affectees, fatalities, house damage, and rainfall intensity.

2. Short Description / Purpose

This dashboard provides a clear, data-driven view of the devastating impact of floods in Pakistan for 2025. It allows government agencies, NGOs, and analysts to track key metrics such as total affectees, fatalities, house damage, and regional breakdowns, helping them prioritize disaster relief and resource allocation effectively.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
‚Ä¢ üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Primary platform for building and visualizing the report.

‚Ä¢ üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Used to clean, transform, and reshape raw flood data.

‚Ä¢ üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Created calculated measures such as total fatalities, house damage percentage, and rainfall correlations.

‚Ä¢ üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Established relationships between district, region, and rainfall tables to enable interactive filtering.

‚Ä¢ üìÅ File Formats ‚Äì .pbix (Power BI project file) for development, .png for visual previews and presentations.

4. Data Source:
   
Source: NDMA (National Disaster Management Authority) Reports, Provincial Disaster Management Departments, and Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).

Data Structure:
District-Level Table: Includes number of affectees, fatalities, and damaged houses per district.
Region Table: Groups districts under provinces/regions (Punjab, Sindh, KPK, GB).
Rainfall Data: Contains mm/hr rainfall intensity per district to correlate with flood severity.

5. Features / Highlights
‚Ä¢ Business Problem

Pakistan experiences recurring floods that displace millions, damage infrastructure, and disrupt livelihoods. Decision-makers lack a unified, interactive way to view real-time disaster impact across regions and districts.

‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard

To provide an interactive, single-page visual summary that:

Tracks key flood impact KPIs across provinces and districts.

Highlights the most affected areas by fatalities and house damage.

Correlates rainfall intensity with fatalities for better disaster prediction and response.

‚Ä¢ Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Key KPIs (Top Row): Total affectees (2M), houses damaged (9,200), fatalities (692), and number of affected districts (11).

Fatalities by District (Bar Chart): Highlights which districts suffered the highest loss of life (Buner, Swat, Lahore, etc.).

Flood Affectees by District (Pie Chart): Distribution of total affectees across all districts.

Houses Destroyed by Region (Bar Chart): Shows provincial distribution of house damage, helping allocate relief funds region-wise.

Map Visualization: Displays district-wise fatalities on Pakistan‚Äôs map for geographic analysis.

Scatter Plot: Compares rainfall intensity (mm/hr) against fatalities per district, revealing rainfall‚Äôs role in loss of life.

Region Filter Panel: Allows users to focus on one province at a time (GB, KPK, Punjab, Sindh).

‚Ä¢ Business Impact & Insights

Relief Prioritization: Helps NGOs and government allocate resources where fatalities and house damage are highest.

Predictive Preparedness: Rainfall-fatality correlation supports early warning systems and better planning for future floods.

Policy Decision Support: Provides data-backed insights for long-term infrastructure improvements (dams, drainage systems).

Transparency: Creates a centralized view of disaster data for stakeholders, improving collaboration between federal and provincial bodies.
